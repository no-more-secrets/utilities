# This script by default will build the latest master commit.  It
# will install it into a folder with a version number.  This version
# number is derived by using `git rev-list`, i.e. the number of
# revisions up to the one at current master.
#
#    --latest-tag : specifying this will cause the latest tag
#                   to be built instead of master, and the version
#                   number will be taken to be the tag name.  Note
#                   that this may not work properly since the script
#                   below references `llvm-current` in a few places,
#                   and so if the llvm-current is not compatible with
#                   the tag being built then it may not work, though
#                   it should probably be fine using llvm-current
#                   because then the llvm version will be "newer"
#                   than the iwyu version (the tag), but this has
#                   not been tested.

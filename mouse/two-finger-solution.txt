From one of the answers here:

  https://askubuntu.com/questions/1387034/touchpad-starts-requiring-2-fingers-way-to-fix

  "I ran into this problem today. I was able to work around it by
  switching to one of the virtual terminals and then back to the
  desktop.

  In my case this was CTRL+ALT+F3, then you can use
  ALT+LEFT_ARROW until you get your desktop back."

For the Darter you can do:

  * CTRL+ALT+F3  ==>  switch to terminal
  * CTRL+ALT+F2  ==>  switch back to desktop

and the problem should have gone away.
